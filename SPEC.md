# SPEC.md — Headless Space Sim

The one planning document. Merges the old PHASE_PLAN.md (near-term build
order, Rounds 11+) with Brian's ideas2 notes (the long-range game), because
the long-range shape decides things in the small playable parts now: what a
laser key does, what a warp costs, what the station sells, what "a module"
even is. Part A is direction — where the game is going, not build
instructions. Part B is the build plan for the playable demo, the thing
Brian wants to show people first. Part C is what's decided vs open.

Read `CLAUDE.md` first: every rule there (ear-first, CFG-only tuning, silent
testing, help + KEY_DESCRIPTIONS + README in sync, commit + push each
round, test at the Pages URL or a local server) applies to every item
below. Brian's ear decides all sound.

Items marked **DECIDE** are open — ask Brian before building them. Items
marked **(accepted by default)** were settled on Claude's recommendation
without an explicit note; build as written unless he says otherwise.

---

## Part A — Where the game is going (direction, shapes the micro)

### A.1 Four scales of movement

1. **Thruster flight** — inside an encounter (combat zone, asteroid cloud,
   a rescue). W/S, arrows, stabilizers. Exists.
2. **Local space** — flying the sector between points of interest by
   beacon. Exists.
3. **Warp jumps** — `H`, within a sector. Exists, but will cost warp
   charge (A.3).
4. **Quadrant jumps** — between sectors on a universe map, through a jump
   gate. Needs hydrogen (A.3). Not built; the gate exists sealed (B, 2.6).

The `Q` map is the sector map. A quadrant map and a universe map are the
same browsable-list widget one and two levels up.

### A.2 Lasers: slots 1–6, fire-and-forget

- Keys **1–6 select a laser slot**; Space fires the selected laser. Each
  laser is data (`LASERS` table): name, sound, burst length, cooldown,
  damage, mining effectiveness. Some are good in combat, some at mining,
  all usable for both, none best at everything — picking the right laser
  for the rock in front of you is part of mining.
- **Fire-and-forget**: one press runs the whole burst (~5 s, Brian's
  number); you do not hold Space, you cannot spam it. A cooldown and/or
  overheat penalty per laser makes each burst a choice.
- The ship starts with two fitted; more are modules bought at the station
  (A.5). The 16 laser recordings in `audio/weapons/lasers/` (Mining ×8,
  Rapid-pulse ×8) are candidates to audition, then assign per laser.
- This changes the demo's current laser (2 s, 4 ticks, 700 ms recharge,
  overheat after two misses in 8 s) — see B, 1.9.

### A.3 Fuel: warp charge and hydrogen

- **Warp charge**: the sector warp drive has a tank. Each jump costs charge
  by distance; the core has to cool and recharge. Early game the tank is
  small, so the pilot can't range far from the starting station. Refill:
  slowly in flight, fully at a station. Bigger tank / faster cooling are
  modules.
- **Hydrogen**: the resource for leaving a quadrant. Sources: the sun of
  the quadrant (later); mining any asteroid with a hydrogen-extractor laser
  enhancement (module); combat drops hydrogen containers to collect. Sink:
  quadrant jumps; until those exist, the station buys it.
- So the resource ladder is: ore (sell) → credits (buy modules) → hydrogen
  (move between quadrants) → influence (A.6).

### A.4 Loot and income

Combat drops containers (hydrogen, ore, credits) collected by flying to
them. Later: planetside resources, trade goods, hauling contracts between
stations. Every income source feeds credits or a resource.

### A.5 The ship is modules

- The player chooses modules as the ship grows: weapon (lasers, missile
  racks, chaff), shield, drive (warp tank, cooling, thrusters), cargo, tools
  (hydrogen extractor, scanner, docking computer). Groups are data.
- Looks don't matter; **mass does**. No friction in space, so every module
  adds mass, mass slows acceleration and turning, and thruster upgrades
  matter. The current CFG `thrust`/`turnRate` become base thrust over ship
  mass.
- A **ship window** (a browsable overlay like help/map/run log) shows hull,
  shields, fuel, cargo, fitted modules per slot.
- The "Upgrades" list in the old station plan is this: modules with mass and
  price, not flat CFG overrides.

### A.6 Stations, influence, control

- Activity in a sector matters. Each station has an **influence** score the
  pilot raises by combat missions for it, selling ore to it, trade runs,
  meeting its needs (rescues, hauling). Station speech and prices reflect
  it.
- Long game: influence enough stations to form a **union**; quadrants end
  up in unions; the player flips, holds, develops, or captures quadrants;
  an automated war runs; a small local AI model writes news stories on the
  fly. Planets and stations can be controlled and **auto-governed** so
  resources collect without micromanagement once the empire is big.
  Possibly a farm game on planets.
- None of this is built. What the demo needs from it now: an influence
  number per station that the existing actions already feed, so the
  economy has its hook from day one (B, 1.7).

### A.7 What stays true at every scale

Ear-first, one live region, left-hand keys, silence is a bug, hidden
mining thresholds never spoken, every attack telegraphed, every rule has an
audible tell. The strategic layer is menus, maps, and speech — the same
widgets the mission menu, quadrant map, and run log already are.

---

## Part B — Build plan (the playable demo first)

Work item by item, one commit per numbered item where practical, stop at the
end of each phase for Brian's play-test. Phase 1 is the demo he shows
people; nothing in Phase 2+ starts without his go.

### Phase 1 — the demo, finished

Done, live on Pages (Rounds 10–12): 1.0 hosting + `?run=delivery`, 1.1
difficulty tiers, 1.2 Rookie Cruiser, 1.3 shield damage pool + disrepair,
1.4 saved profile + run log, 1.5 no-warp zone, 1.9 laser slots and 1.10
warp charge (both machine-tested, not yet heard by Brian — see below), and
the audio split
(`audio_engine.js` / `audio_cues.js`, see CLAUDE.md "Audio architecture").

Suggested order for the rest — the docking corridor and station next,
since everything else hangs off them, then chaff:

#### 1.9 Laser slots and fire-and-forget (from A.2) — DONE, needs Brian's ear

Built and machine-tested (slot select 1–6 including empty slots, fire-and-
forget with `G` refused mid-burst, both damage profiles firing in the right
shape, per-slot cooldown with spoken recharge, overheat still reachable,
mining and combat both exercised, `E`/`V` unaffected) — not yet heard.
Real per-tick numbers are still placeholders; Brian sets them by ear.

One gotcha found in testing, already fixed: `laserMissWindowMs` (the "two
misses overheat it" window) was still 8000 ms from the old 2 s beam. A 5 s
burst plus the 3 s cooldown puts the natural gap between two misses at
~8 s, so the old window made overheat unreachable. Moved to 11000 (Ace
16000, keeping the same proportional tightening) — first candidate to
retune once Brian has heard the new rhythm.

- `LASERS` data table; each entry `{ id, name, asset, ticks: [..],
  tickS, cooldownS, hullMult, rockMult }`. **Damage is a per-tick
  profile, not one number**: the laser hits harder on some ticks than
  others, and the profile matches the shape of that laser's sound (Brian:
  "a laser might hit 5, 5, 25, 20, 10, 5, 5"). Five ticks per burst. The
  ship starts with the first two mining-laser recordings: slot 1 =
  `Mining_laser 1`, steady damage every tick; slot 2 = `Mining_laser 2`,
  two heavy ticks then steady. Placeholder totals match today's burst (100
  at point-blank, perfect aim); Brian sets the real per-tick numbers by
  ear once he's heard each recording against its profile. Slots 3–6 empty:
  "Slot 3 is empty. Fit a laser at the station."

- `LASERS` data table; each entry `{ id, name, asset, ticks: [..],
  tickS, cooldownS, hullMult, rockMult }`. **Damage is a per-tick
  profile, not one number**: the laser hits harder on some ticks than
  others, and the profile matches the shape of that laser's sound (Brian:
  "a laser might hit 5, 5, 25, 20, 10, 5, 5"). Five ticks per burst. The
  ship starts with the first two mining-laser recordings: slot 1 =
  `Mining_laser 1`, steady damage every tick; slot 2 = `Mining_laser 2`,
  two heavy ticks then steady. Placeholder totals match today's burst (100
  at point-blank, perfect aim); Brian sets the real per-tick numbers by
  ear once he's heard each recording against its profile. Slots 3–6 empty:
  "Slot 3 is empty. Fit a laser at the station."
- Keys `1`–`6` select: "Slot 2, mining laser two." Space fires the
  selected slot. Selection persists in the profile.
- Fire-and-forget, **cannot be stopped** (Brian: decided): Space starts the
  burst and it runs every tick to the end. Each tick still scales by aim
  quality and the point-blank multiplier, and the spoken number is the
  aim feedback. The recording plays as the beam's voice (a subtle
  playback-rate rise with aim quality keeps a trace of today's pitch
  narration; the synthesized carrier is the fallback if the asset is
  missing). Consequence: `G` during a burst is refused ("Laser burst in
  progress, 3 seconds.") — you commit to the burst, then shield. That's
  the strategic cost **(accepted by default)**.
- Then `cooldownS` before that slot fires again ("Mining laser one
  recharging, 3 seconds."), spoken on a refused press, never silent.
  **Misses still matter** (Brian: decided): the two-empty-bursts overheat
  stays on top of the cooldown.
- Enemy beams are 5 s already; a 5 s player beam changes the duel's rhythm
  — flag for the play-test.
- Help, KEY_DESCRIPTIONS (1–6), README, and the `I` status ("Slot 2,
  mining laser two, ready") all updated. The two recordings get decoded
  into `audio_assets.js` (mono 96k like the rest) — the first new
  recordings connected to the game.

#### 1.10 Warp charge (from A.3) — DONE, needs Brian's ear

Built and machine-tested: the three-leg route flies as designed (leg 1
arrives with a quarter tank; legs 2 and 3 run dry ~850–870 out with the
map saying "beyond warp range by N" first), the tank refills on leaving
an encounter and at the station ("Warp tank filled"), `I` reads the
charge, a dry tank refuses with "Fly it, or let the core cool", and the
open-flight regen hiss starts and stops cleanly. Not yet heard.

One thing found in testing, already handled: the no-warp zone makes the
pilot fly 1500 clear of an encounter before jumping, and the DIRECTION
they leave changes the next leg by up to 3000. The tank is therefore
sized against the best exit (toward the next target): `warpTankMax`
12500, not the 14000 first pencilled in. Leave the wrong way and it's a
longer thrust in — the map's reach line says so before the jump. If that
feels punishing in play, widen the tank a little or shrink the no-warp
zone; both are one number.

- The tank is measured in distance: `warpCharge` up to `warpTankMax`.
  A jump spends charge by distance flown — and if the nav target is
  farther than the charge, the drive still jumps, drops the pilot out
  where the tank runs dry, and the rest is flown by ear ("Warp charge
  exhausted. Asteroid Field Kappa dead ahead, distance 500."). No refusal,
  no stranding: a dry tank just means thrusting the last stretch.
- Refill: full at the station, and full on completing or leaving an
  encounter (the core cools while you fight and mine — Brian: assume the
  tank fills in combat and in mining). Slow regen in open flight
  (`warpRegenPerS`, an audible core-cooling hiss that fades as it fills)
  so nobody is ever stuck, but slow enough that waiting isn't the plan.
- **The demo route** (Brian: decided): new players start right outside
  Station Meridian with a full tank. Leg 1, station → Contested Zone, is
  within one full tank. Leg 2, Contested Zone → Field Kappa, is a little
  MORE than one tank, so the pilot thrusts the last ~500. Leg 3, Field
  Kappa → station, is the same shape as leg 2: the tank runs dry ~500 out
  and the last stretch is flown in. `SECTOR_POIS` positions and
  `warpTankMax` get tuned together to produce exactly those three legs;
  the existing `warpDropout` (600 short of any target) still applies when
  the tank reaches.
- `I` reads charge; the map lines read each point's distance and whether
  the tank reaches it. Bigger tank and faster cooling are modules (1.7).

#### 1.6 Docking approach (the corridor)

The station is entered by flying a corridor, not by pressing C at 500. This
is deliberately the HARDEST version now; a docking-computer module loosens
it later.
- Calling the station (C within `poiInteract`) answers "Meridian control:
  cleared to dock. Approach corridor active." and starts the approach.
- Corridor = a line from a point `dockCorridorLen` 800 out to the station
  door, on a fixed heading per station (data on `SECTOR_POIS`). Instruments
  on the UI bus, NOT HRTF (a cockpit instrument, like the tick):
  centerline tone panned by lateral offset (off to the right = tone on the
  left = turn left, the tick's convention; dead center = mono); glide slope
  as that tone's pitch (up = high); range as a click rate quickening toward
  the door; over `dockMaxSpeed` 25 inside the last 300 = "Too fast. Abort."
  and a reset to the corridor entry (no damage yet).
- Success inside `dockRadius` 40 at ≤ `dockMaxSpeed`: docking clunk,
  "Docked at Station Meridian.", the station menu opens. Ship held; thrust
  keys answer "Docked. Undock from the station menu."
- Coaching every ~3 s in the corridor: "Left 40, high 10, range 500"
  (round10), silent when centered. All numbers in CFG.

#### 1.7 Station menu (the economy hook)

A KC-style list — make `listMenu(items, opts)` reusable so the mission menu,
station menu, run log, ship window, and every future menu share one
implementation.
- Items: Sell ore · Sell hydrogen · Repair · Rearm · Restock chaff · Refuel
  · Modules ▸ · Undock.
- **Sell**: `orePrice` 1 credit per 10 ore, `hydrogenPrice` (placeholder).
  Speaks the sale and the balance. The delivery-run handover is the ore
  sale (quota met → run complete when sold).
- **Repair / Rearm / Restock / Refuel**: credits (`repairCost` per hull
  point, `missileCost`, `chaffCost`, `refuelCost` per charge point). In the
  delivery run the FIRST repair+rearm+refuel is free (the clock is the
  cost); everything else costs.
- **Modules ▸** (from A.5): `MODULES` table `{ id, name, group, mass, cost,
  effects }`. First list: shield spool 1.5 → 1.0 s; shield pool +50 %;
  missile rack 8 → 12; the second and third lasers (from `LASERS`); warp
  tank +50 %; core cooling ×2; thruster upgrade (offsets mass); hydrogen
  extractor (mining ticks also yield hydrogen); docking computer (widens
  the corridor, Phase 2). Each line speaks price, mass, and whether you can
  afford it. Owned modules live in the profile and apply at boot; mass
  feeds thrust/turn.
- **Influence** (from A.6): `profile.stations[id].influence`, raised by
  delivery, combat clears at that station's zone, sales, rescues. Spoken
  on docking ("Meridian control. Good to see you again, pilot." past a
  threshold). No consumer beyond speech and a price break yet.
- **Undock**: pushes the ship 100 out along the corridor heading, "Undocked.
  Clear of the station." Escape = Undock.

#### 1.11 Ship window (from A.5) — deferred past the demo

- Not needed for the demo (Brian). When it comes: a browsable overlay
  (same shell as the run log) — hull, shields, warp charge, hydrogen, ore,
  credits, missiles, chaff, one line per slot, total mass; Escape closes.
  Brian's direction: screens like this end up on **function keys** (F2
  and up), the way F1 is help — not on letter keys.

#### 1.8 Countermeasures (chaff)

- Key `D` ("decoy") **(accepted by default)**. Menu D still jumps to
  Delivery run; KEY_DESCRIPTIONS says both.
- `chaffMax` 4, restocked at the station. One press spoofs the CURRENT
  incoming missile (it loses guidance at once, the existing ballistic
  coast), no shield needed. A bright crackling burst at the ship (UI bus),
  "Chaff away. 3 left." Useless against beams: "Chaff does nothing against a
  laser. Shields." With nothing inbound it STILL fires and wastes one
  (Brian: decided): "Chaff away, nothing inbound. 3 left."
- Veteran/Ace enemies may launch a second missile while the first coasts;
  Rookie never does.

### Phase 2 — a living sector, smarter enemies, the second resource

#### 2.1 Distress calls + rescue-and-tow (new, not combat/mining)

- Every `distressMinS`–`distressMaxS` (120–300 s) of open-sector flight a
  distress call may spawn 3000–6000 out: a temporary POI with an SOS beacon
  (three short, three long, three short, thin 1 kHz), announced once:
  "Distress call. Bearing 40 left. Q for the map." Fades after
  `distressLifeS` 240.
- Answering (C within 500) enters the **rescue encounter**:
  1. A survival pod within 800 transmits a weak intermittent signal that is
     not a normal target: no Tab, no radar. Loudness tracks distance only,
     no panning until within 250, then it snaps into HRTF. Finding it is
     warmer/colder by ear.
  2. Within 250 it becomes a target. It drifts at 10–20; **match speed**:
     within `towMatchDist` 60 with relative speed under `towMatchSpeed` 8
     for 2 s, narrated by a beat frequency that slows to zero as speeds
     match.
  3. `E` latches the tow ("Tow line secure."). Above `towMaxSpeed` 60 the
     line strains (rising creak), snaps at `towSnapSpeed` 75 ("Tow line
     parted."); re-latch by matching again.
  4. Within 500 of the station: "Pod recovered. Meridian control sends
     thanks, and 300 credits." Influence up.
- Gentle flying and listening, the opposite of combat. Variants later: a
  miner adrift (tow a core), a freighter under attack (combat, then tow).

#### 2.8 Loot containers and hydrogen (from A.3/A.4) — NEW

- A destroyed ship drops a container (target kind `'loot'`, a soft
  intermittent beacon at the wreck, drifts slowly, fades after
  `lootLifeS`). Fly within `lootPickupDist` 100 and `V` collects it:
  "Container: 40 hydrogen." Contents from a `LOOT` table by ship class.
- `hydrogen` joins ore in the hold and the `I` status; the hydrogen
  extractor module makes mining ticks yield it too. The station buys it
  (1.7). The quadrant jump is its real sink (Phase 4).

#### 2.2 Ship classes with different brains

`SHIP_CLASSES` table keyed from the roster:
- **Interceptors** (Raider, Scout): close-range laser attackers; strafe
  after every attack (reuse the evade code) so the pilot re-acquires them;
  prefer to attack while the pilot's shields are recharging.
- **Corvette** (Drone): pack animal; attacks only while another hostile is
  mid-attack or within 3 s after (two threats may overlap; cap 2, Rookie 1).
- **Cruisers** (Freighter, Cruiser): stand-off; missiles only from ≥ 700;
  back away if the pilot closes inside 500.
- Rookie keeps every class passive until hit; classes change HOW they
  fight, not WHEN.

#### 2.3 Adaptive commander (enemies that learn the pilot)

Not machine learning; tendencies the enemies read, updated per encounter,
saved in the profile. Code name `commander`.
- Tracked: mean shield reaction time after a lock warning; share of
  attacks shielded; mean laser engagement distance; laser-vs-missile kill
  ratio; mean shield hold; chaff usage rate.
- Rules (`COMMANDER_RULES`, thresholds in CFG): fast shield reaction →
  interceptor FEINTS (lock chirps with no beam, 30 %, then a real attack
  when the shield drops); shields most attacks → cruisers time missiles
  for the collapse/recharge, packs overlap more; fights close →
  interceptors strafe more, cruisers retreat earlier; relies on missiles →
  evade on LAUNCH at Veteran+; uses chaff often → missile pairs at
  Veteran+.
- Every rule has an audible tell (a feint's chirps are slightly detuned).
  Speech never explains the rule. Rookie: observes, applies only the feint
  rule at half rate.

#### 2.4 Gas clouds (new POI type)

"Nebula Gas Pocket Theta", soft broadband hiss beacon. 3–5 gas pockets
(kind `'gas'`) with a breathy HRTF voice. `V` harvests at 2× the dust rate;
gas sells at 3× ore. Lasering a pocket ignites it: flash-bang at its
position, hull damage 15 within 200, pocket gone. Missiles the same at any
range. The wrong tool hurts — and the right laser (A.2) matters here.

#### 2.5 Asteroid hazards

A rock faster than `rockDangerSpeed` 40 passing within `rockHitDist` 60
strikes the ship: hull damage by size and speed, a scraping crunch (UI bus)
plus the rock's own impact at its position. A rising proximity tone (UI
bus, panned toward it) from 300 in. Mostly a consequence of missiling a
medium rock at close range.

#### 2.6 Jump gate POI (sealed, now with a purpose)

"Jump Gate Tau": deep cyclic hum, periodic discharge. Calling it: "Gate
control: transit lane not commissioned. Hydrogen reserves insufficient."
It is the sector's exit and hydrogen's sink; opening it is Phase 4.

#### 2.7 Mining scanner

`N` scans the selected rock: sonar ping from the ship, echo from the rock
(HRTF), then "Iron. Rich." / "Ice. Lean." A hint, never a number — hidden
thresholds stay hidden. Later a module tells you which laser suits it.

### Phase 3 — teaching and hosting

#### 3.1 Tutorial shell (framework only)

`TUTORIAL_STEPS` `{ say, expect: { key | condition }, then }`; the runner
speaks a step, waits, advances; Escape leaves; a "Tutorial" menu item.
Three steps only (W, Tab, lock) until mechanics settle — the laser change
in 1.9 is exactly why the content waits.

#### 3.2 Hosting, second pass

Lazy-load the ship loops and new recordings over fetch on https (base64
stays for file://); a service worker for offline play; a share page. The
double-click file keeps working.

### Phase 4 — the strategic layer (direction only, no specs yet)

Quadrants and the universe map · opening the gate with hydrogen · the sun as
a hydrogen source · station influence into unions · flipping, holding,
developing, capturing quadrants · automated war · auto-governed stations
and planets · planetside resources, trade goods, hauling contracts · a
planet farm game · a local AI model writing news. Each becomes a phase with
numbered items when it's next; none of it starts before the demo is heard.

## Part C — Decisions

Decided (Brian, 2026-09-04): chaff wastes a round when nothing is
inbound; the mining scanner is in; Pages is the test reference; lasers are
fire-and-forget on slots 1–6 and **cannot be stopped**; **misses still
matter** (overheat stays on top of the cooldown); damage is a **per-tick
profile matched to the laser's sound**; the demo ships with **Mining_laser
1 (steady) and Mining_laser 2 (two heavy ticks, then steady)**; warp has a
tank measured in distance and the demo route is station → combat (one
tank) → mining (tank + ~500 flown) → station (tank + ~500 flown); the tank
refills in encounters and at the station; the ship window is **not for the
demo** and screens like it go on **function keys**; hydrogen gates
quadrants; modules have mass; **lasers are built first**; the single-file
demo is gone for good.

Accepted by default (say otherwise): shields as a damage pool; credits and
modules persist across sessions; chaff on `D`; `G` refused during a
laser burst; slow warp regen in open flight so a dry tank never strands.

**DECIDE** (open): the real per-tick damage numbers for each laser — set by
Brian's ear after hearing each recording against its profile; the code
ships placeholders.

## Deferred (Brian: "not yet")

Enemy shields · subsystem damage sounds (no cue design yet) · nebula
muffling · full tutorial content · fully inert systems.

## Test checklist per item

- Every new key answers in every mode (silence is a bug), including docked,
  corridor, rescue, the station menu, and the ship window.
- F12 explore describes every new key; F1 help has a section per new
  mechanic; README key table updated.
- `window.__sim.state()` exposes the new state (lasers, warp charge,
  hydrogen, modules, corridor, tow, commander) and `poke` can force a
  distress call, drop a container, set credits, set the shield pool.
- localStorage blocked/absent → game still runs.
- Commit; push; wait for the Pages deploy; re-test at the URL; close every
  browser tab and stop the local server.
